## Description

Have you never programmed a computer before, and think or say that C is a good programming language to start with. this is.

Maybe you have some good experience with other programming languages, but want to learn C. This is great language for your resume.

Or perhaps you are stuck in a low-paid programming job and want to move to a better, more senior position. Learning C can help you.

The fact is, learning to program in C is not only an excellent programming language, to begin with, but it will make you better at programming in other computer languages.

## Why learn C?
C is often considered the mother of all languages ​​because many other languages ​​have been based on it.

Although C is simple it is one of the most powerful languages ​​ever created. Given that it was built over 40 years ago, it is still heavily used and is generally one of the top 5 or 10 most popular and most comprehensive programming languages ​​in the world.

Learning C can actually make you better at programming in other languages ​​like C ++, Java, or C #, which equips you with a mental model of the computer while running your programs.

By learning how things really work "under the hood", and understanding CPU architecture, memory space, and so on, you can build more efficient programs, and get a bigger advantage over other programmers in the process Huh.

If you want to be a better developer, C is a great way to start learning!

It does not skip over the course description. You will learn how to write high-quality code and how to be an excellent problem solver. This course does not only exist to code in the C programming language but, includes all the details on the "why" you are doing. At the end of this course, you will be able to fully understand the concepts of the C programming language.
